Ask me anything (or type 'exit' to quit):
i will be in paris on may 18 for a week with my wife, what to pack?

Assistant: Paris in May can be quite lovely! Given the expected temperatures between 9.5°C and 22.1°C, I suggest packing for a mix of cooler mornings and warmer afternoons. Here's a practical packing list for you and your wife:

**Essentials:**

* 3-4 tops or blouses (lightweight, breathable fabrics)
* 2-3 pairs of pants or trousers (comfortable, versatile options)
* 1-2 dresses or skirts (optional, but perfect for a Parisian evening stroll)
* 1-2 light jackets or sweaters (for cooler mornings and evenings)
* Undergarments and socks
* A warm coat or jacket (it can get chilly in the mornings, especially around the Eiffel Tower)

**Comfortable Shoes:**

* 1 pair of comfortable walking shoes or sneakers
* 1 pair of dress shoes or nicer sandals for evening events

**Toiletries:**

* Toothbrush, toothpaste, and dental floss
* Deodorant, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash
* Razor and shaving cream (if applicable)
* Hairbrush or comb
* Makeup and makeup remover (if applicable)

**Electronics:**

* Smartphone and charger
* Laptop and charger (if necessary)
* Camera and charger (if you're an avid photographer)
* Portable charger (a good idea, especially if you plan on taking a lot of photos)

**Miscellaneous:**

* Reusable water bottle
* Umbrella or raincoat (Paris can be rainy, even in the spring)
* Snacks (especially if you have specific dietary needs or preferences)
* Guidebook, map, or downloaded city guide on your smartphone
* Pocket change in euros for when you arrive

**Additional Tips:**

* Pack layers, as the temperature can fluctuate significantly throughout the day.
* Consider packing clothes that can be easily mixed and matched to create multiple outfits.
* Don't forget to check the dress code for any specific events or restaurants you plan on visiting.
* Leave some extra space in your luggage for souvenirs and shopping!

Enjoy your time in Paris with your wife!
